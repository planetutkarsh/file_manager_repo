THE BROAD-BACKED hippopotamus   
Rests on his belly in the mud;  
Although he seems so firm to us 
He is merely flesh and blood.   
 
 Flesh and blood is weak and frail,         5
 Susceptible to nervous shock;  
 While the True Church can never fail   
 For it is based upon a rock.   
  
  The hippo’s feeble steps may err  
  In compassing material ends,          10
  While the True Church need never stir 
  To gather in its dividends.   
   
   The ’potamus can never reach 
   The mango on the mango-tree; 
   But fruits of pomegranate and peach          15
   Refresh the Church from over sea.    
    
    At mating time the hippo’s voice    
    Betrays inflexions hoarse and odd,  
    But every week we hear rejoice  
    The Church, at being one with God.          20
     
     The hippopotamus’s day 
     Is passed in sleep; at night he hunts; 
     God works in a mysterious way— 
     The Church can sleep and feed at once. 
      
      I saw the ’potamus take wing          25
      Ascending from the damp savannas, 
      And quiring angels round him sing 
      The praise of God, in loud hosannas.  
       
       Blood of the Lamb shall wash him clean   
       And him shall heavenly arms enfold,          30
       Among the saints he shall be seen    
       Performing on a harp of gold.    
        
        He shall be washed as white as snow,    
        By all the martyr’d virgins kist,   
        While the True Church remains below         35
        Wrapt in the old miasmal mist.
